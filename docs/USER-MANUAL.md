**Example pasting a job description directly:**

```
Here's the job description:

       SENIOR CLOUD SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT
       Contoso Ltd — Seattle, WA (Hybrid)

       ABOUT THE ROLE
       We are looking for a Senior Cloud Solutions Architect to join our
       Platform Engineering team. You will design and implement cloud-native
       solutions on Microsoft Azure, drive technical strategy for our
       enterprise customers, and mentor a team of 4 engineers. This is a
       high-impact role at the intersection of architecture, AI integration,
       and developer experience.

       RESPONSIBILITIES
       - Design scalable, resilient cloud architectures using Azure services
         (AKS, Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Azure OpenAI).
       - Lead technical discovery sessions with enterprise clients to translate
         business requirements into cloud-native solutions.
       - Build proof-of-concept applications and reference architectures that
         showcase best practices for microservices and event-driven design.
       - Mentor and grow a team of cloud engineers, conducting code reviews
         and establishing engineering standards.
       - Collaborate with Product and DevRel teams to shape the developer
         platform roadmap and publish technical content.

       QUALIFICATIONS
       - 7+ years of software engineering experience, with 3+ years focused
         on cloud architecture (Azure preferred, AWS acceptable).
       - Strong proficiency in C#/.NET, Python, or Go for backend services.
       - Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.
       - Familiarity with AI/ML integration patterns (Azure OpenAI, Semantic
         Kernel, or similar frameworks).
       - Excellent communication skills — able to present to both technical
         and executive audiences.
       - Microsoft Azure certifications (Solutions Architect Expert or
         equivalent) preferred.

       COMPENSATION
       $165,000 – $210,000 base + annual bonus + equity
```

If you skip both the resume and job description, the coach will ask general interview questions.

---

### Step 4: Behavioral interview

The coach begins with behavioral questions tailored to your resume and job description. Questions follow the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

**Example:**

```
Coach: Let's start with a behavioral question.
       Tell me about a time you led a technical project through a challenging deadline.
       Try to structure your answer using the STAR method.

You:   In my previous role, we had a project to migrate our infrastructure to Azure.
       The deadline was tight because of a contract renewal. I organized the team into
       workstreams, set up daily standups, and we delivered two days early.

Coach: Great answer! Here's my feedback:
       ✅ Situation: Clear context about the migration project
       ✅ Task: Well-defined goal with deadline pressure
       ✅ Action: Good leadership actions (workstreams, standups)
       💡 Improvement: Add specific metrics — how many services migrated?
          What was the team size? Quantifiable results strengthen your answer.

       Would you like another behavioral question, or move to technical questions?
```

Typically the coach asks **3-5 behavioral questions**. After each answer, you receive:

- Constructive feedback on your response
- Analysis of your STAR structure
- Suggestions for improvement

---

### Step 5: Technical interview

When you're ready, the coach switches to technical questions based on the skills in your resume and job description.

**Example:**

```
You:   Let's move to technical questions.

Coach: Sure! Here's a technical question:
       You need to design a microservices architecture for a high-traffic
       e-commerce platform on Azure. Walk me through your approach,
       including service communication, data management, and scaling.

You:   I'd use Azure Container Apps for the services, with Azure Service Bus
       for async messaging between them. Each service would have its own
       database — SQL for orders, Cosmos DB for the product catalog...

Coach: Solid approach! Here's my analysis:
       ✅ Good choice of Azure Container Apps for managed containers
       ✅ Event-driven with Service Bus — good for decoupling
       ✅ Polyglot persistence is appropriate
       💡 Consider: How would you handle distributed transactions?
          What's your caching strategy for the product catalog?

       Want to continue with more technical questions?
```

---

### Step 6: End the interview and get a summary

When you're done, ask the coach to wrap up. The coach generates a comprehensive summary.

**Example:**

```
You:   I'd like to stop and get a summary.

Coach: Here's your interview summary:

       📋 Interview Summary
       ═══════════════════════════════════════
       
       Overview:
       You completed a mock interview session with 3 behavioral
       and 2 technical questions for a Cloud Solution Architect role.

       Key Highlights:
       • Strong leadership examples with clear STAR structure
       • Solid technical knowledge of Azure services
       • Good communication and structured thinking

       Areas for Improvement:
       • Add more quantifiable metrics to behavioral answers
       • Dive deeper into distributed systems trade-offs
       • Prepare more examples of cross-team collaboration

       Recommendations:
       1. Practice explaining complex architectures in under 2 minutes
       2. Prepare 3-4 STAR stories with specific metrics ready
       3. Review CAP theorem and consistency patterns for system design

       Overall Readiness: 🟢 Good — ready for interviews with some

## Multi-agent mode

By default the app runs the multi-agent mode with LLM (`AgentMode: LlmHandOff`). To use a single-agent mode or multi-agent with GitHub Copilot instead, set `AgentMode` to either `Single` or `CopilotHandOff` in `apphost.settings.json`:

```json
{
  // Single-agent mode
  "AgentMode": "Single",

  // Multi-agent mode with GitHub Copilot
  "AgentMode": "CopilotHandOff",
}
```

In multi-agent mode, five specialized agents collaborate:

| Agent                      | What It Does                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Triage**                 | Routes your messages to the right specialist                 |
| **Receptionist**           | Sets up your session, parses your resume and job description |
| **Behavioral Interviewer** | Asks behavioral questions using the STAR method              |
| **Technical Interviewer**  | Asks role-specific technical questions                       |
| **Summariser**             | Generates your final interview summary                       |

Handoffs happen automatically — you just chat normally and the system routes to the right specialist.

See [MULTI-AGENT.md](MULTI-AGENT.md) for details.

## Tips

1. **Provide both resume and JD** — more context means more relevant questions.
2. **Answer in detail** — longer answers get better feedback.
3. **Use the STAR method** — Situation, Task, Action, Result.
4. **Ask for clarification** — the coach can rephrase.
5. **Run multiple sessions** — each one is saved. Try different job descriptions.
6. **Stop anytime** — say "stop" to get your summary early.

## Common scenarios

### Resume from LinkedIn

```
You: Hi my resume is here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe/
```

The coach uses MarkItDown to extract your profile information and tailors questions to your experience.

### Resume from a hosted PDF

```
You: My resume is at https://mysite.com/resume.pdf
```

### Skip resume, just provide a job description

```
You: I don't have a resume handy, but here's the job: https://careers.example.com/job/12345
```

### Practice with samples

Use the included samples:

```
You: Can you use the sample resume for Peter Parker?
```

> Note: The sample files in `samples/` are PDFs. You would need to provide them as accessible URLs or paste their content.

### Resume later

```
You: I need to go. Can I resume later?
Coach: Of course! Your Session ID is a1b2c3d4-...
       Just mention this ID when you come back and we'll pick up where you left off.
```
