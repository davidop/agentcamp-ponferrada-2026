# Learning Objectives

This sample demonstrates production-ready patterns for building AI agents with Microsoft Agent Framework. Whether you're new to AI development or experienced with chatbots, this application teaches modern architectural patterns that scale from prototype to production.

## What This Sample Teaches

### 1. **Building Production AI Agents**

Learn how to create AI agents using [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://aka.ms/agent-framework) with:

- Structured instruction design for consistent agent behavior
- Tool/function calling patterns for extending agent capabilities
- Stateful conversation management across sessions
- Error handling and graceful degradation

**See it in action:** [src/InterviewCoach.Agent/Program.cs](../src/InterviewCoach.Agent/Program.cs#L95-L125) contains the complete agent instructions and tool registration.

### 2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**

Understand how MCP servers provide modular, reusable capabilities:

- Separating agent logic from tool implementation
- Creating language-agnostic tool interfaces
- Enabling tool reuse across different agents and applications
- Building custom MCP servers for domain-specific needs

**Example implementations:**

- [MarkItDown MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) - External document parsing
- [InterviewData MCP](../src/InterviewCoach.Mcp.InterviewData/) - Custom session management server

### 3. **Multi-Service Orchestration with .NET Aspire**

Master service orchestration patterns:

- Coordinating multiple services (agent, UI, MCP servers, databases)
- Managing dependencies and startup order
- Local development with production parity
- Environment-specific configuration

**Key file:** [src/InterviewCoach.AppHost/AppHost.cs](../src/InterviewCoach.AppHost/AppHost.cs) orchestrates all components.

### 4. **Multi-Provider LLM Integration**

Implement provider abstraction for flexibility:

- Single codebase supporting multiple LLM providers
- Runtime provider selection via configuration
- Environment-specific provider strategies (dev vs. prod)
- Avoiding vendor lock-in

**Provider factory pattern:** [src/InterviewCoach.AppHost/LlmResourceFactory.cs](../src/InterviewCoach.AppHost/LlmResourceFactory.cs)

### 5. **Stateful Conversation Management**

Build agents that maintain context across sessions:

- Persistent session storage with SQLite
- Resume/job description attachment handling
- Conversation transcript recording
- Multi-turn interview flow management

**Database integration:** [src/InterviewCoach.Mcp.InterviewData/InterviewSessionRepository.cs](../src/InterviewCoach.Mcp.InterviewData/InterviewSessionRepository.cs)

### 6. **Agent Instruction Engineering**

Craft effective agent instructions:

- Clear role definition and boundaries
- Step-by-step process guidelines
- Tool usage instructions
- Tone and personality specification

**Best practices example:** The interview coach agent instructions demonstrate progressive disclosure (behavioral → technical questions), user control (stopping mid-interview), and structured output (summaries).

## Why These Patterns Matter

### **Extensibility Without Modification**

MCP servers let you add capabilities (email, calendar, document processing) without touching agent code. This follows the Open-Closed Principle and enables teams to work independently on tools and agents.

### **Provider Flexibility**

The multi-provider pattern means you can:

- Use GitHub Models for rapid prototyping (free)
- Switch to Azure OpenAI for enterprise features
- Deploy to Foundry for integrated Azure AI services
- All without rewriting application logic

### **Production-Ready Architecture**

.NET Aspire orchestration provides:

- Service discovery and health checks
- Observability with OpenTelemetry built-in
- Configuration management across environments
- Seamless Azure deployment with `azd`

### **Separation of Concerns**

Each component has a single responsibility:

- **Agent**: Interview orchestration and conversation management
- **MCP Servers**: Specific capabilities (document parsing, data storage)
- **WebUI**: User interface and interaction
- **AppHost**: Service orchestration and configuration

This makes the codebase maintainable, testable, and easy to extend.

## Real-World Applications

The patterns in this sample apply directly to:

### **Customer Service Automation**

- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Session state persistence
- Tool integration for CRM/ticketing systems
- Escalation workflows

### **Technical Support Agents**

- Document analysis (logs, configuration files)
- Knowledge base integration
- Diagnostic workflows
- Issue tracking

### **Educational Tutors**

- Adaptive question progression
- Student progress tracking
- Resource recommendations
- Assessment generation

### **Domain-Specific Assistants**

- Healthcare intake interviews
- Financial advisory conversations
- Legal document analysis
- Research assistants

### **Multi-Step Workflow Automation**

- Data collection across multiple steps
- Validation and verification
- Summary report generation
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
