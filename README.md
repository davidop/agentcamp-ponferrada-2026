# Interview Coach with Microsoft Agent Framework

An AI-powered interview coach that shows how to wire up [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://aka.ms/agent-framework), [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), and [Aspire](https://aspire.dev) into a working application you can deploy.

## What you'll learn

This sample covers the patterns you'd need for a real agent deployment:

- Building AI agents with Microsoft Agent Framework
- Multi-agent handoff orchestration — single agent vs. 5 specialized agents
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for adding tools without touching agent code
- Running multiple services together with Aspire
- Keeping conversation state across sessions
- Swapping LLM providers (Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Models, GitHub Copilot)
- Deploying to Azure with `azd up`

See [learning objectives](docs/LEARNING-OBJECTIVES.md) for the full breakdown.

## Architecture

![Overall architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

The app is split into a few services:

- **Aspire** orchestrates everything (service discovery, health checks, config)
- **WebUI** is a Blazor chat interface
- **Agent** runs the interview logic via Microsoft Agent Framework
- **MCP Servers** handle document parsing (MarkItDown) and session storage (InterviewData)
- **LLM Provider** talks to Foundry, Azure OpenAI, or GitHub Models

See [architecture overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the pieces fit together.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- [Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) + [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
- [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
- [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com)

See [LLM provider options](docs/providers/README.md) for alternatives.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/interview-coach-agent-framework.git
cd interview-coach-agent-framework
```

### 2. Configure Microsoft Foundry

1. Create a new Microsoft Foundry project on Foundry Portal or command line.

   See [Foundry setup guide](docs/providers/MICROSOFT-FOUNDRY.md) for details.

### 3. Store Credentials

Use .NET user secrets to keep credentials secure:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets --file ./apphost.cs set MicrosoftFoundry:Project:Endpoint "{{MICROSOFT_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}}"
dotnet user-secrets --file ./apphost.cs set MicrosoftFoundry:Project:ApiKey "{{MICROSOFT_FOUNDRY_API_KEY}}"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start all services with .NET Aspire:

```bash
aspire run --file ./apphost.cs
```

**What happens next:**

1. Open Aspire Dashboard (URL shown in terminal output).
1. All services start (Agent, WebUI, MCP servers, SQLite).
1. Look for ✅ "Running" status on all resources.
1. Click the **webui** endpoint to open the interview coach.

### 5. Deploy to Azure

Deploy the entire application to Azure Container Apps with one command:

```bash
# Login to Azure
azd auth login

# Provision resources and deploy
azd up
```

### 6. Clean Up Resources

When finished, remove all Azure resources:

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

### Alternative LLM providers

The default is Microsoft Foundry, but you can also use:

- [Azure OpenAI](docs/providers/AZURE-OPENAI.md) — direct AOAI integration
- [GitHub Models](docs/providers/GITHUB-MODELS.md) — free tier, good for prototyping
<!-- - [GitHub Copilot](docs/providers/GITHUB-COPILOT.md) — local dev with Copilot SDK -->

### Alternative agent mode

The default is `LlmHandOff`, but you can also use:

- [`Single`](docs/MULTI-AGENT.md#mode-1-single-agent) - single-agent mode
<!-- - [`CopilotHandOff`](docs/MULTI-AGENT.md#mode-3-multi-agent-handoff-gitHub-copilot) - multi-agent mode with GitHub Copilot -->
